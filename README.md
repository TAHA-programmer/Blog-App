### 1. **Splash Screen**
The app begins with a splash screen that uses an image edited to create an engaging introduction. It checks the authentication state of the user using Firebase Authentication. Depending on whether the user is logged in or not, it navigates to either the Home Screen or the Option Screen after a brief delay.

### 2. **Login Screen**
The login screen allows users to access their accounts. It includes:
- **Email and Password Fields**: For user input.
- **Forgot Password Option**: If a user forgets their password, they can tap this option, which navigates them to a screen where they can enter their email address to receive a password reset email through Firebase.

### 3. **Option Screen**
This screen provides options for users to either log in or register. It serves as a gateway to the authentication system.

### 4. **User Authentication with Firebase**
User registration and authentication are handled via Firebase:
- **Registration**: Users enter their name, email, phone number, and password. This data is stored in a Firestore collection named `my_data`. Upon registration, the user's email and password are also added to Firebase Authentication.
- **Login**: Users log in using their email and password. If successful, they are directed to the Home Screen.

### 5. **Home Screen**
After logging in, users land on the Home Screen:
- **Post Display**: Initially, the screen displays a message indicating no posts are available. Users can create new posts.
- **Add Post Button**: A "+" icon in the app bar allows users to navigate to the Add Post screen.

### 6. **Add Post Screen**
In this screen, users can create new blog posts:
- **Image Selection**: Users can select an image from their gallery or take a new one using the camera.
- **Title and Description Fields**: Users provide a title and description for the post.
- **Upload Button**: Upon clicking this button, the post data (image URL, title, and description) is uploaded to the `posts` collection in Firestore. After uploading, users are redirected back to the Home Screen.

### 7. **Post Detail Screen**
When users click on a post in the Home Screen:
- They navigate to the Post Detail Screen, which displays the full image, title, and description of the selected post.

### 8. **Profile Management**
In the Home Screen, there's a drawer with user information:
- **Profile Picture**: Users can upload a profile picture that they can take from the camera or select from the gallery.
- **My Profile Section**: Tapping this leads to a profile screen displaying the user's name, email, and phone number.

### 9. **Logout Functionality**
The Home Screen includes a logout button in the app bar. When tapped, it signs the user out of Firebase Authentication and navigates them back to the login screen.

### 10. **Error Handling and User Experience**
Throughout the app, you've included appropriate error handling for Firebase operations, ensuring users are informed of successes or issues through toast messages.

### Backend Configuration
The backend for this app includes:
- **Firebase Authentication**: For managing user accounts and sessions.

- **Firebase Storage**: For storing uploaded images.

This comprehensive structure creates a seamless experience for users, allowing them to register, log in, manage their profile, create posts, and navigate easily throughout the app. Each part of the code is designed to ensure functionality and a user-friendly interface, making it an effective blogging platform.
